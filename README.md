# This project uses R to build somple simulation model to predict the probable winner and score of the Premier Leage Match
# between any two team. App is based on the theory that Football goals can be modeled by Poisson Regression. There are some 
# assumotions which might not be applicable in real life game but this model can help to some extent extrapolate the possible
# results
