Shinny dashboard for premier league simulation. 

 This project uses R to build simple simulation model to predict the probable winner and score of the Premier Leage Match
 between any two team. App is based on the theory that Football goals can be modeled by Poisson Regression. There are some 
 assumptions which might not be applicable in real life game but this model can help to some extent extrapolate the possible
 results.
